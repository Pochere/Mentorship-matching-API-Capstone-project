# Mentorship-matching-API-Capstone-project
A Mentorship matching API that connects mentors and mentees based on their skills and interests. The goal is to allow mentees to search for mentors who have expertise in specific areas and to enable mentors to accept or decline mentorship requests. This project solves a real problem.
